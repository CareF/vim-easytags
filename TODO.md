# Long term plans

 * Integration with my unreleased project plug-in so that when you edit any
   file in a project, all related files are automatically scanned for tags?

 * Use separate tags files for each language stored in ~/.vim/tags/ to increase
   performance because a single, global tags file quickly grows to a megabyte?
